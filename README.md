# Python-Coding

## Background
Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation in analyzing banking data and helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process

## PyBank
In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records. I was given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

The task was to create Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
* In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll
During the second part of the challenge I was given poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset was composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
* In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
