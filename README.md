# Python-Coding

### Background
Both of these challenges encompass a real-world situation in analyzing banking data and helping a rural town modernize its vote counting process.

### Part I - PyBank
During part one I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing a financial data set called, budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

The Python script that analyzes the financial data was supposed to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
* In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

### Part II - PyPoll
During the second part of the challenge I was given a poll dataset called election_data.csv. The dataset was composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 

The Python script that analyzes the votes was supposed to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
* In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
